\chapter{Bellman optimality and indexability}
\label{ch:mbp}

In this chapter, we present two structured MDPs known as rested and restless markovian bandit.

\section{A new notion of optimality: Bellman optimal}
\label{ch:mbp:sec:bell}

Gain optimal policies do not capture the information that we need when dealing with Markovian bandit problem.
Hence, we introduce a new notion of optimality which is crucial for Chapter~\ref{ch:index_computation}.
%In an ergodic MDP, the single recurrent class is the state space of the MDP and gain optimal policy

\subsection{Definition of Bellman optimality}

By \cite[Theorem~9.1.7]{puterman2014markov}, gain optimal policy can be identified by any solution $(\vg^*, \vh^*)$ of \eqref{eq:gain_opt} and \eqref{eq:bias_opt} (recall that $\vg^*$ is, however, uniquely defined).
That is, any policy $\pi$ that satisfies $\sum_{s'\in\gS}p\bigl(s'\mid s,\pi(s)\bigr)g^*(s')=g^*(s)$ and $\pi(s)\in\argmax_{a\in\gA_s}\Big(r(s,a) +\sum_{s'\in\gS}p(s'\mid s,a)h^*(s')\Big)$ for all state $s$ is gain optimal.
In vector notation, if $\mP^{\pi}\vg^*=\vg^*$ and $\pi\in\argmax_{\pi'\in\Pi}\Bigl(\vr^{\pi'}+\mP^{\pi'}\vh^*\Bigr)$, then $\pi$ is gain optimal.
However, this way of identification is restrictive for gain optimal policies in a sense that is shown
in \figurename~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman}.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \begin{tabular}{cc}

            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{minipage}
        &
        \begin{minipage}{.7\linewidth}
            There are two policies $\pi^1$ where $\pi^1(1){=}\pi^1(2){=}0$ and $\pi^2$ where $\pi^2(1){=}1$ and $\pi^2(2){=}0$.
            Both policies are gain optimal.
            By solving \eqref{eq:gain_opt} and \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, we have $\vg^*=\vone$ and $\vh^*{=}c\vone$ where $c$ can be any real number.
            Consequently, $\mP^{\pi^1}\vg^* =\vg^*$ and $\mP^{\pi^2}\vg^* =\vg^*$ but
            policy $\pi^1$ does not satisfies the maximum of \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on state $1$ for any $\vh^*$ while $\pi^2$ does.
            So, policy $\pi^2$ is more restrictive than $\pi^1$.

    \label{fig:gain_vs_bellman}
\end{figure}

So, we define a new notion of optimality as the following.
\begin{defn}[Bellman optimal policy]
    \label{ch:mbp:defn:bellman}
    %Consider a MDP in which the space $\gS$ is finite and $\gA_s$ is finite for any $s\in\gS$.
    A policy $\pi$ is \emph{Bellman optimal} if there exists a vector $\vh^*\in\R^{\abs{\gS}}$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} with $\vg^*$ such that $\sum_{s'\in\gS}p\bigl(s'\mid s,\pi(s)\bigr)g^*(s')=g^*(s)$ and $\pi(s)\in\argmax_{a\in\gA_s}\Big(r(s,a) +\sum_{s'\in\gS}p(s'\mid s,a)h^*(s')\Big)$ for all $s\in\gS$.
\end{defn}
By \cite[Theorem~9.1.7]{puterman2014markov}, Bellman optimal policy always exists in MDPs with finite state and action spaces and Bellman optimal implies gain optimal.
However, we will see in Section~\ref{ssec:gain_charac} that the converse is not true in general.
That is the reason why the notion of Bellman optimality is more restrictive than the notion of gain optimality.
%We give an example in \figurename~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman} to illustrate the difference between Bellman and gain optimalities.
%By this definition, policy $\pi^2$ in \figurename~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman} is Bellman optimal.

This definition is very natural and we say that it is new because to the best of our knowledge the definition is never introduced elsewhere.
Note that the distinction between Bellman and gain optimal disappears in infinite horizon discounted problems or ergodic MDPs for average reward criterion.

A Bellman optimal policy can be obtained using \emph{Multichain Policy Iteration} algorithm.
We refer to \cite[Section~9.2.1]{puterman2014markov} for more detail about this algorithm.

\subsection{Advantage function and characterization of Bellman optimal policies}

Let $\vg$ and $\vh$ be a solution of Bellman evaluation equations \eqref{eq:gain_eval} and \eqref{eq:bias_eval} for policy $\pi$.
We define the (dis-)advantage of action\footnote{Note that it is also a function of $\vh$.} $a\in\gA_s$ in state $s$ over policy $\pi$ by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:advan}
    B^a_s(\vg,\vh) := r(s,a) +\sum_{s'\in\gS}p(s'\mid s,a)h(s') -g(s) -h(s).
\end{equation}
If $\pi$ is unichain, then $\vh$ is determined up to a constant vector and $B^a_s(\vg,\vh)$ is then uniquely defined for any $s\in\gS$, $a\in\gA_s$, and $(\vg,\vh)$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:gain_eval} and \eqref{eq:bias_eval}.
%$\vh\in\R^{\abs{\gS}}$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_eval}.

For $(\vg^*,\vh^*)$ a solution of Bellman optimality equations \eqref{eq:gain_opt} and \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, %an action $a$ in state $s$ that satisfies $B^{a^*}_s(\vg^*,\vh)=0$ is potentially optimal.
an optimal action $a\in\gA_s$ for state $s$ satisfies both ${\sum_{s'\in\gS}p(s'\mid s,a)g^*(s')} =g^*(s)$ and $B^a_s(\vg^*,\vh^*)=0$ \cite{puterman2014markov, schweitzer1978functional}.

\begin{lem}
    \label{ch:mbp:lem:bellman_charac}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item \label{it:opt_bm1} A policy $\pi:\gS\mapsto\gA$ is Bellman optimal if and only if there exists a vector $\vh^*\in\R^{\abs{\gS}}$ that satisfies Bellman optimality equation \eqref{eq:bias_opt} with $\vg^*$ such that $\mP^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ and $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*)=0$ for all states $s\in\gS$.

        \item \label{it:opt_bm2} (just in case we need it) A policy $\pi:\gS\mapsto\gA$ is Bellman optimal if and only if there exists a vector $\vh\in\R^{\abs{\gS}}$ that satisfies Bellman evaluation equation \eqref{eq:bias_eval} for $\pi$ with $\vg^*$ such that $\mP^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ and $B^a_s(\vg^*,\vh)\le0$ for all action $a\in\gA_s$ and all state $s\in\gS$.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    \ref{it:opt_bm1} is a direct consequence of Definition~\ref{ch:mbp:defn:bellman} and \eqref{eq:advan}.

    \ref{it:opt_bm2} By definition of advantage function, $B^a_s(\vg^*,\vh)\le0$ for all action $a\in\gA_s$ and all state $s\in\gS$ if and only if $\vh$ satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.
    Moreover, if $\vh$ satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_eval} for $\pi$ with $\vg^*$, then $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh)=0$ for all states $s\in\gS$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Difference between gain and Bellman optimal policies}
\label{ssec:gain_charac}
%To understand our new notion of optimality, we first need to characterize the gain optimal policies.
%To highlight the difference between Bellman and gain optimalities, we prove a lemma that characterizes the gain optimal policies.
%For this purpose, we define a notion of (dis-)advantage of an action with respect to a given policy.
%So, an optimal action has null advantage with respect to an optimal policy.

%The following lemma characterizes gain optimal policy by showing that the policy satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on their recurrent states for any $\vh^*$. % a solution of \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.

Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:bellman_charac} shows that any Bellman optimal policy satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on all states for some $\vh^*$.
The following lemma shows that any gain optimal policy satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on its recurrent states for any $\vh^*$.
So, both lemmas show the difference between gain and Bellman optimal policies.
\begin{lem}
    \label{ch:mbp:lem:opt_pol}
    Let $\pi:\gS\mapsto\gA$ be a policy and $\Phi^\pi$ be the set of recurrent states under policy $\pi$.
    The three properties below are equivalent.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item \label{it:opt_pol1} $\mP^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ and for all $\vh^*\in \R^{\abs{\gS}}$ satisfying \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*)=0$ for all $s\in\Phi^\pi$
        \item \label{it:opt_pol2} $\mP^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ and for some $\vh^*\in \R^{\abs{\gS}}$ satisfying \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*)=0$ for all $s\in\Phi^\pi$
        \item \label{it:opt_pol3} $\pi$ is gain optimal.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    First of all, given a policy $\pi$, we define the \emph{limiting matrix} $\bar{\mP}^\pi{:=}\displaystyle\Clim_{t\to+\infty}{(\mP^\pi)^t}$ (\cite[Appendix~A.4]{puterman2014markov}). % which describes the state transition in steady regime under policy $\pi$. That is, $\bar{P}^\pi(s,s')$ is the probability that the MDP transitions from state $s$ to $s'$ in steady regime.
    Since the MDP has finite state space, $\bar{\mP}^\pi$ always exists and well-defined for any stationary policy $\pi$.
    It describes the state transition in steady regime under policy $\pi$.
    That is, $\bar{P}^\pi(s,s')$ is the probability that the MDP transitions from state $s$ to $s'$ in steady regime.
    By \cite[Theorem~8.2.6]{puterman2014markov}, the gain of policy $\pi$ can be expressed by $g^\pi(s)=\sum_{s'\in\gS}\bar{P}^\pi(s,s')r^\pi(s')$ for any $s\in\gS$.
    In vector notation, $\vg^\pi=\bar{\mP}^\pi\vr^\pi$.
    %We denote by $\Phi^\pi$ the set of recurrent states under policy $\pi$.
    From \cite[Section~A.4]{puterman2014markov}, we have
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\bar{\mP}^\pi\mP^\pi =\mP^\pi\bar{\mP}^\pi =\bar{\mP}^\pi$
        \item If $s'\notin\Phi^\pi$, then $\bar{P}^\pi(s,s')=0$ for all $s\in\gS$
        \item If $\pi$ is unichain, then the rows of $\bar{\mP}^\pi$ are identical.
    \end{itemize}
    Now, we can prove the lemma.

    \ref{it:opt_pol1} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{it:opt_pol2} is trivial.

    \ref{it:opt_pol2} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{it:opt_pol3}: By definition of $B_s^a(\vg^*,\vh^*)$, we have $r^{\pi}(s)-g^*(s) = h^*(s)-\sum_{s'\in\gS} P^{\pi}(s,s')h^*(s')$ for any recurrent state $s$ of $\pi$.  Multiply this with $\bar{P}^\pi(j,s)$ and sum over $s\in\gS$ (if $s$ is not recurrent, then $\bar{P}^\pi(j,s)=0$) gives
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{s\in\gS} \bar{P}^\pi(j,s)\Big(r^{\pi}(s)-g^*(s)\Big) {=} \sum_{s\in\gS} \bar{P}^\pi(j,s)h^*(s) {-} \underbrace{\sum_{s\in\gS} \bar{P}^\pi(j,s)\sum_{s'\in\gS} P^{\pi}(s,s')h^*(s')}_{=\sum_{s'\in\gS} \bar{P}^\pi(j,s')h^*(s') \text{ since $\bar{\mP}^\pi\mP^\pi{=}\bar{\mP}^\pi$.}}
        = \vzero.
    \end{align*}
    The gain of $\pi$ is $\bar{\mP}^\pi \vr^\pi$.
    The above equation shows that $\bar{\mP}^\pi\vr^\pi = \bar{\mP}^\pi\vg^*$. Moreover, the assumption  $\mP^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ implies that $\bar{\mP}^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ which in turn implies that $\bar{\mP}^\pi\vr^\pi=\vg^*$. This shows that the gain of $\pi$ is $\vg^*$ and therefore $\pi$ is gain optimal.
    % So, we have $\mP^\pi\vg^*=\vg^*$ and $\bar{\mP}^\pi(\vr^\pi-\vg^*)=\vzero$.

    \ref{it:opt_pol3} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{it:opt_pol1}: If $\pi$ is gain optimal, then $\mP^\pi \vg^*=\vg^*$ and $\bar{\mP}^\pi(\vr^\pi-\vg^*)=\vzero$.
    The latter rewrites as $\sum_{s\in\gS}\bar{P}^\pi(j,s)\Big(r^{\pi}(s)-g^*(s)\Big) =0$ for all state $j$. For some $\vh^*$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, we have: for all state $j$
    \begin{align*}
        %\label{eq:apx_proof_H}
        \sum_{s\in\gS}\bar{P}^\pi(j,s)B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*) {=} \sum_{s\in\gS}\bar{P}^\pi(j,s)\Big(r^{\pi}(s)-g^*(s) {+}\sum_{s'\in\gS}P^{\pi}(s,s')h(s') -h^*(s)\Big) {=}0.
    \end{align*}
    As $\vh^*$ satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, we have $B^{a}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*) \le0$  for all action $a\in\gA_s$ and all states $s\in\gS$. In particular, $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*) \le0$.
    This shows that for any state $s$ such that $\bar{P}^\pi(j,s)>0$, one must have $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*) =0$. Such state $s$ are the recurrent states of $\pi$.
    This shows that $B^{\pi(s)}_s(\vg^*,\vh^*) =0$ for all $s\in\Phi^\pi$.
\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:opt_pol} shows that gain optimal policies achieve the maximum of \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on their recurrent states.
We say that the gain optimal policies \emph{act optimally} in their recurrent states.
This lemma is useful to prove the properties of Bellman optimal policy in the following section.
%With this characterization, in ergodic MDPs, a policy is gain optimal if and only if it acts optimally in all states.
%However, for MDPs that admit transient states, a policy can be gain optimal without acting optimally in all states, \ie, it acts optimally in its recurrent states and possibly randomly in the transient states.
%We give an example in Figure~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman} in which there are two gain optimal policies.
%One of them achieves the maximum of $\eqref{eq:bias_opt}$ in all states.

\paragraph{Remark.} The characterization of gain optimal policies was analysed in \cite{puterman2014markov, schweitzer1978functional}.
However, it was expressed and proved differently from what we have done for Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:opt_pol}.

%\subsection{Definition of Bellman optimality}
%
%The gain optimal policies give more importance to the reward in steady regime. 
%That is, they act optimally in recurrent states and possibly randomly in transient states.
%In this thesis, we distinguish gain optimal policies from the policies that attain the maximum of \eqref{eq:bias_opt} in all states as the following.
%\begin{defn}[Bellman optimal policy]
%    \label{defn:bellman}
%    %Consider a MDP in which the space $\gS$ is finite and $\gA_s$ is finite for any $s\in\gS$.
%    A policy $\pi$ is \emph{Bellman optimal} if there exists vector $\vh\in\R^{\abs{\gS}}$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} with $\vg^*$ such that $\pi(s)\in\argmax_{a\in\gA_s}\Big(r(s,a) +\sum_{s'\in\gS}p(s'\mid s,a)h(s')\Big)$ for all $s\in\gS$.
%\end{defn}
%By \cite[Theorem~9.1.7]{puterman2014markov}, Bellman optimal policy always exists in MDPs with finite state and action spaces and Bellman optimal implies gain optimal.
%However, the converse is not true in general.
%So, the notion of Bellman optimality is stronger than the notion of gain optimality.
%By this definition, policy $\pi^2$ in \figurename~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman} is Bellman optimal.
%
%Note that the distinction between Bellman and gain optimal disappears in discounted MDPs or ergodic MDPs for average reward criterion.
%
%A Bellman optimal policy can be obtained using \emph{Multichain Policy Iteration} algorithm.
%We refer to \cite[Section~9.2.1]{puterman2014markov} for more detail about this algorithm.

\subsection{A shift between bias vectors of two unichain Bellman optimal policies}

%The previous lemma shows that a policy is gain optimal if and only if the actions for the recurrent states of the policy satisfy \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.
The previous lemma shows that a policy is gain optimal if and only if the actions for the recurrent states of the policy satisfy \eqref{eq:bias_opt} for any $\vh^*$. % a solution to this \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.
However, some gain optimal policies induce bias vector that is not a solution of \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.
That is, in \figurename~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman}, the bias of policy $\pi^1$ is $h^{\pi^1}(1)=c-0.5$ and $h^{\pi^1}(2)=c$ and the bias of policy $\pi^2$ is $\vh^{\pi^2}(1)=c\vone$ where $c$ is any real number.
Recall that $\vh^{\pi^1}$ is the solution of \eqref{eq:bias_eval} for $\pi^1$ and $\vh^{\pi^2}$ for $\pi^2$.
So, $\vh^{\pi^1}$ does not satisfy \eqref{eq:bias_opt} but $\vh^{\pi^2}$ does.
While $\pi^1$ and $\pi^2$ are both gain optimal policies, unichain, and share one common recurrent state, namely state $2$ (see \figurename~\ref{fig:gain_vs_bellman}), we still cannot generalize the relationship between $h^{\pi^1}(s)$ and $h^{\pi^2}(s)$ for all states $s$.
In contrast, the following lemma clarifies this question for Bellman optimal policies that are unichain and share at least one common recurrent state.
%In contrast, the following lemma shows the relationship between two Bellman optimal policies that are unichain and share at least one common recurrent state.
%The previous lemma shows that a gain optimal policy satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on its recurrent states for any $\vh$ a solution of \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.
%An interesting question to ask is whether a Bellman optimal policy satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} on all states for any $\vh$ a solution of \eqref{eq:bias_opt}.

\begin{lem}
    \label{ch:mbp:lem:equi_bias}
    Suppose that two policies $\pi$ and $\theta$ are Bellman optimal, unichain and have at least one common recurrent state: $\Phi^\pi\cap\Phi^\theta\neq\emptyset$.
    
    Then for any $\vh^\pi$ and $\vh^\theta$ solutions of \eqref{eq:bias_eval} for $\pi$ and $\theta$ respectively, there exists a constant $c$ such that for all state $s$: $h^\pi(s) -h^\theta(s) =c$. Moreover, in this case, ${B_s^{\theta(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\pi)=B_s^{\pi(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\theta)=0}$ for all $s$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    We define $\bar{\mP}^\pi$ and $\bar{\mP}^\theta$ for policies $\pi$ and $\theta$ respectively as we did in the proof of Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:opt_pol}.
    Since $\pi$ and $\theta$ are Bellman optimal, $\vh^\pi$ and $\vh^\theta$ satisfy \eqref{eq:bias_opt} together with $\vg^*$.
    In consequence, we have
    \begin{align*}
        \vh^\pi \ge \vr^\theta -\vg^* +\mP^\theta\vh^\pi.
    \end{align*}
    By Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:opt_pol}~\ref{it:opt_pol1}, the above inequality is an equality for all $s\in\Phi^\theta$ because $\theta$ is gain optimal.

    As $\vh^\theta$ satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_eval}, we have
    \begin{align*}
        \vh^\theta -\vh^\pi &\le \vr^\theta -\vg^* +\mP^\theta\vh^\theta -(\vr^\theta -\vg^* +\mP^\theta\vh^\pi) = \mP^\theta(\vh^\theta -\vh^\pi),
    \end{align*}
    with equality for all state $s\in\Phi^\theta$. This shows that for all $t$, $\vh^\theta -\vh^\pi\le (\mP^\theta)^t(\vh^\theta -\vh^\pi)$ which implies that $\vh^\theta -\vh^\pi\le \bar{\mP}^\theta(\vh^\theta -\vh^\pi)$ with equality for all states $s\in\Phi^\theta$. Similarly, $\vh^\pi -\vh^\theta \le \bar{\mP}^\pi(\vh^\pi -\vh^\theta)$ with equality for any state $s\in\Phi^\pi$.

    Let $c^\pi_s=\sum_{s'\in\gS}\bar{P}^\pi(s,s')\Big(h^\pi(s')-h^\theta(s')\Big)$ and $c^\theta_s=\sum_{s'\in\gS}\bar{P}^\theta(s,s')\Big(h^\pi(s')-h^\theta(s')\Big)$. By what we have just shown, for all state $s$, we have
    \begin{align*}
        c^\theta_s \underbrace{\le}_{\text{equality if $s\in\Phi^\theta$}} h^\pi(s)-h^\theta(s) \underbrace{\le}_{\text{equality if $s\in\Phi^\pi$}} c^\pi_s
    \end{align*}
    As both policies are unichain, $c^\pi_s$ and $c^\theta_s$ do not depend on $s$.
    Moreover, if there exists $s\in\Phi^\theta\cap\Phi^\pi$, then $c^\pi_s=c^\theta_s = c$. In consequence,  $h^\pi(s)-h^\theta(s)=c$ for all state $s$. 
    Furthermore, by definition advantage function, $B_s^{\pi(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\pi)=B_s^{\pi(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\theta)=0$ and $B_s^{\theta(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\theta)=B_s^{\theta(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\pi)=0$ for all state $s$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Unicity of Bellman optimal policy.}
\label{ssec:unicity}

In some problems, it is crucial to check if the MDP has a single Bellman optimal policy.
By Definition~\ref{ch:mbp:defn:bellman}, this task is not trivial due to the multiplicity of the solution to \eqref{eq:bias_opt} given $\vg^*$.
So, the following lemma shows a condition which can be used to verify if a given Bellman optimal and unichain policy is the unique one.

\begin{lem}
    \label{ch:mbp:lem:unicity_BO}
    Let $\pi$ be a Bellman optimal policy that is unichain. If $\pi$ is not the unique Bellman optimal policy, then there exists a state $s$ and an action $a\in\gA_s\setminus\{\pi(s)\}$ such that $B_s^a(\vg^*,\vh^\pi)=0$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\theta\neq\pi$ be another Bellman optimal policy. Since $\theta$ is gain optimal and $\vh^\pi$ satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt}, Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:opt_pol}~\ref{it:opt_pol1} implies that $B_s^{\theta(s)}(\vg^*,\vh^\pi) =0$ for all $s\in\Phi^\theta$. If there exists $s\in\Phi^\theta$ such that $\theta(s)\neq\pi(s)$, then the proof is concluded.  Otherwise, $\theta(s)=\pi(s)$ for all $s\in\Phi^\theta$.
    This show that $\theta$ and $\pi$ coincide for all recurrent states of $\theta$ and that $\Phi^\theta=\Phi^\pi$. Moreover, as $\pi$ is unichain, $\theta$ is also unichain. Hence, Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:equi_bias} implies that $B_s^{\theta(s)}(\vg^*, \vh^\pi)=0$ for all $s$. Since $\theta\neq\pi$, there exists at least one state $s\in\gS$ such that $\theta(s)\neq\pi(s)$.
\end{proof}
Lemma~\ref{ch:mbp:lem:unicity_BO} implies that a Bellman optimal and unichain policy $\pi$ is the unique one if and only if for all $s$, $B_s^a(\vg^*, \vh^\pi)<0$ for all $a\in\gA_s\setminus\{\pi(s)\}$.
Note that if a weakly communicating MDP has a single Bellman optimal policy, the policy must be unichain.
Indeed, suppose that in a given weakly communicating MDP there exists a Bellman optimal policy that is multichain with two recurrent classes $\Phi^1$ and $\Phi^2$.
Then, we can construct two unichain Bellman optimal policies:
%, each satisfies \eqref{eq:bias_opt} for some possibly different $\vh$ a solution to \eqref{eq:bias_opt}
$\pi^1$ that ends up in $\Phi^1$ and $\pi^2$ that ends up in $\Phi^2$.
Since the MDP is weakly communicating, the optimal gain is state independent: the optimal gain of any state in $\Phi^1$ is the same as the optimal gain of any state in $\Phi^2$.
So, both $\pi^1$ and $\pi^2$ are Bellman optimal.
%These handmade unichain policies are Bellman optimal.

However, in MDPs that are not weakly communicating, it is possible that a single Bellman optimal policy is multichain as given in \figurename~\ref{fig:unique_mutichain}.

            The unique Bellman optimal policy is $\pi^1$ where $\pi^1(1)=0$ and $\pi^1(2)=0$.
            It is clear that $\pi^1$ is multichain policy.
            This MDP is not weakly communicating because state $1$ is not accessible by state $2$ and there is no transient states.
